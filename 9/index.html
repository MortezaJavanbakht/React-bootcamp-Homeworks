        <h3>Horse</h3>
        <p>
          The horse is one of two extant subspecies of Equus ferus. It is an
          odd-toed ungulate mammal belonging to the taxonomic family Equidae.
          The horse has evolved over the past 45 to 55 million years from a
          small multi-toed creature, Eohippus, into the large, single-toed
          animal of today.
