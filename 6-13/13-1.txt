PWA:
Progressive Web Applications (PWAs) are apps built with web technologies that we probably all know 
and love, like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. But they have the feel and functionality of an actual native app. 

PWAs are built with the capabilities like push notifications and the ability to work offline. They 
are also built on and enhanced with modern APIs which makes it easy to deliver improved capabilities 
along with reliability and the ability to install them on any device.

PWAs takes advantage of the huge web ecosystem this is inclusive of the plugins, and community and 
the relative ease of deploying and keeping a website contrary to a native application which is pretty 
difficult to develop. This means you can build a PWA quickly and easily.
