The OSI Model is a logical and conceptual model that defines network communication used by systems 
open to interconnection and communication with other systems. The Open System Interconnection (OSI
 Model) also defines a logical network and effectively describes computer packet transfer by using
  various layers of protocols.

TCP/IP helps you to determine how a specific computer should be connected to the internet and how 
you can transmit data between them. It helps you to create a virtual network when multiple 
computer networks are connected together.
TCP/IP stands for Transmission Control Protocol/ Internet Protocol. It is specifically designed as
 a model to offer highly reliable and end-to-end byte stream over an unreliable internetwork.


Key Difference Between TCP/IP and OSI Model
-OSI has 7 layers, whereas TCP/IP has 4 layers.
-The OSI Model is a logical and conceptual model that defines network communication used by systems 
 open to interconnection and communication with other systems. On the other hand, TCP/IP helps you 
 to determine how a specific computer should be connected to the internet and how you can be 
 transmitted between them.
-OSI header is 5 bytes, whereas TCP/IP header size is 20 bytes.
-OSI refers to Open Systems Interconnection, whereas TCP/IP refers to Transmission Control Protocol.
-OSI follows a vertical approach, whereas TCP/IP follows a horizontal approach.
-OSI model, the transport layer, is only connection-oriented, whereas the TCP/IP model is both 
 connection-oriented and connectionless.
-OSI model is developed by ISO (International Standard Organization), whereas TCP Model is developed
 by ARPANET (Advanced Research Project Agency Network).
-OSI model helps you to standardize router, switch, motherboard, and other hardware, whereas TCP/IP
 helps you to establish a connection between different types of computers.
