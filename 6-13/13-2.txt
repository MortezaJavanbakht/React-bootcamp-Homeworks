SPA:
An SPA (Single-page application) is a web app implementation that loads only a single web document, 
and then updates the body content of that single document via JavaScript APIs such as XMLHttpRequest 
and Fetch when different content is to be shown.

This therefore allows users to use websites without loading whole new pages from the server, which 
can result in performance gains and a more dynamic experience, with some tradeoff disadvantages such 
as SEO, more effort required to maintain state, implement navigation, and do meaningful performance monitoring.

Benefits:
-SPA is fast, as most resources (HTML+CSS+Scripts) are only loaded once throughout the lifespan of application. 
 Only data is transmitted back and forth.
-The development is simplified and streamlined. There is no need to write code to render pages on the server. 
It is much easier to get started because you can usually kick off development from a file file://URI, without 
 using any server at all.
-SPAs are easy to debug with Chrome, as you can monitor network operations, investigate page elements and data
 associated with it.
-Itâ€™s easier to make a mobile application because the developer can reuse the same backend code for web 
 application and native mobile application.
-SPA can cache any local storage effectively. An application sends only one request, store all data, then it
 can use this data and works even offline.
