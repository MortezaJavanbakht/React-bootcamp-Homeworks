ICMP: (No Port)
The Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP) is a network layer protocol used by network devices to 
diagnose network communication issues. ICMP is mainly used to determine whether or not data is 
reaching its intended destination in a timely manner. Commonly, the ICMP protocol is used on 
network devices, such as routers.

IMAP: (143)
Internet Message Access Protocol (IMAP) is a protocol for accessing email or bulletin board messages 
from a (possibly shared) mail server or service. IMAP allows a client e-mail program to access 
remote message stores as if they were local. Email stored on an IMAP server can be manipulated from 
a workstation at the office, a desktop computer at home or a notebook computer while traveling, 
without requiring the transfer of messages or files back and forth between these computers.

RDP: (3389)
Remote desktop protocol (RDP) is a secure network communications protocol developed by Microsoft. 
It enables network administrators to remotely diagnose problems that individual users encounter and 
gives users remote access to their physical work desktop computers.
RDP can be used by employees working from home or traveling who need access to their work computers. 
RDP is also often used by support technicians who need to diagnose and repair a user's system 
remotely and by admins providing system maintenance.

Telnet: (23)
Telnet is an application protocol used on the Internet or local area network to provide a 
bidirectional interactive text-oriented communication facility using a virtual terminal connection.
User data is interspersed in-band with Telnet control information in an 8-bit byte oriented data 
connection over the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP).
