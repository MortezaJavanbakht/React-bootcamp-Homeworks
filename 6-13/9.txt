SSL stands for Secure Sockets Layer and, in short, it's the standard technology for keeping an 
internet connection secure and safeguarding any sensitive data that is being sent between two 
systems, preventing criminals from reading and modifying any information transferred, including 
potential personal details. The two systems can be a server and a client (for example, a shopping 
website and browser) or server to server (for example, an application with personal identifiable 
information or with payroll information).

It does this by making sure that any data transferred between users and sites, or between two 
systems remain impossible to read. It uses encryption algorithms to scramble data in transit, 
preventing hackers from reading it as it is sent over the connection. This information could be 
anything sensitive or personal which can include credit card numbers and other financial 
information, names and addresses.
